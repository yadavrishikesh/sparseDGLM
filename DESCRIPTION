Title: Fit Sparse (based on SPDE apprach) Spatiotempoal Dynamic Generalized Linear Model
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package provides a sparse spatiotemporal modeling framework for dynamic generalized linear models (DGLMs) tailored to bike count data. Sparsity is introduced through precision matrices derived from the Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) approximation of a continuous spatial field, following the approach outlined by Lindgren et al. (2011). The package also supports fitting models with dense Matérn covariance structures, as well as simpler Poisson GLMs with a Poisson response."
